# Password-Generator
A password generator that randomly creates a password for the user to use based on the password size given by the user. The password follows the general criteria for strong passwords from NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology) and generic criteria for strong passwords that are followed world wide.
You'll only be required to give the size of the password to create, the rest will be taken care of by the script.
